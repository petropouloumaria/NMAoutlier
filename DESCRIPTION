Description: A set of functions providing several outlier (i.e., studies with extreme findings) and influential detection measures and methodologies in network meta-analysis :
               - simple outlier and influential detection measures
               - outlier and influential detection measures by considering study deletion (shift the mean)
               - plots for outlier and influential detection measures
	       - Q-Q plot for network meta-analysis
               - Forward Search algorithm in network meta-analysis. 
               - forward plots to monitor statistics in each step of the forward search algorithm
               - forward plots for summary estimates and their confidence intervals in each step of forward search algorithm.
