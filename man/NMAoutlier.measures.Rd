\description{
This function calculates several (simple or/and deletion) measures
for detection of outliers and influential studies in network
meta-analysis.

Outlier and influential detection measures are: \itemize{ \item
Simple outlier and influential measures for each study (Raw
residuals, Standardized residuals, Studentized residuals,
Mahalanobis distance, leverage).  \item Outlier and influential
deletion measures for each study (Shift the mean) (Raw deleted
residuals, Standardized deleted residuals, Studentized deleted
residuals, Cook distance between the treatment estimates for study
j and treatment estimates when study j is removed; Ratio of
determinants of variance-covariance matrix of treatment estimates
for study j to treatment estimates when study j is removed; weight
leave one out;leverage leave one out; heterogeneity estimator leave
one out; R statistic for heterogeneity; R statistic for Q
(\code{Qtotal}), R statistic for heterogeneity Q (\code{Qhet}), R
statistic for Qinconsistency (\code{Qinc}), DFbetas.)  }
}
\details{
Outlier and influential detection measures (simple or deletion) for network meta-analysis.
Network meta-analysis from graph-theory [Rücker, 2012] is fitted
with (\code{netmeta} function) of R package \bold{netmeta} [Rücker et al., 2015].

A description of the outlier and influential detection measures in the context of network meta-analysis
can be found in Petropoulou (2020).

Let \emph{n} be the number of treatments in a network and let
\emph{m} be the number of pairwise treatment comparisons.  If there
are only two-arm studies, \emph{m} is the number of studies. Let
\code{TE} and \code{seTE} be the vectors of observed effects and their standard
errors. Comparisons belonging to multi-arm studies are identified
by identical study labels (argument \code{studlab}).

This function calculates outlier and influential detection measures for each study.
Simple outlier and influential measures (\code{measure} = "simple") are:
Raw residuals, Standardized residuals, Studentized residuals, Mahalanobis distance
and leverage for each study.
For deletion outlier and influential measures (\code{measure} = "deletion"):
Standardized deleted residual; Studentized deleted residual; Cook distance between the treatment estimates for study j
and treatment estimates when study j is removed;
Ratio of determinants of variance-covariance matrix of treatment estimates for study j to treatment estimates when study j is removed;
Weight leave one out;leverage leave one out; heterogeneity estimator leave one out;
R statistic for heterogeneity;  R statistis for estimates; R statistic for Q (\code{Qtotal}),  R statistic for  heterogeneity Q
(\code{Qhet}), R statistic for Qinconsistency (\code{Qinc}), DFbetas.
